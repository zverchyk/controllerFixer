# Vancouver Controller Repair

A one-page controller repair site for Xbox and PS5 controllers, built with
Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui primitives, Motion, React Hook
Form, Zod, and Resend.

## Local development

```bash
npm install
<<<<<<< HEAD
cp .env.example .env.local
=======
>>>>>>> cursor/controller-repair-site-6dc6
npm run dev
```

## Environment variables

Copy `.env.example` and fill in the values you use. The repair form needs
`RESEND_API_KEY`. The admin page needs the Sanity values below.

## Spam protection

Create a Cloudflare Turnstile widget for your domain and paste its two keys
above. Use your real keys, not Cloudflare's demo keys — the demo keys render a
"For testing only. If seen, report to site owner" notice on the widget.

Without `NEXT_PUBLIC_TURNSTILE_SITE_KEY` the widget is not rendered at all, and
without `TURNSTILE_SECRET_KEY` the server skips verification. In both cases the
form still submits normally.

## Repair request emails

Requests are emailed to `techoleks@gmail.com` with the subject
<<<<<<< HEAD
"Controller fix request", and replies go straight back to the customer. Set
`REPAIR_REQUEST_EMAIL` to send somewhere else, and `REPAIR_FROM_EMAIL` once you
have a verified Resend domain (the default sender is `onboarding@resend.dev`,
which only delivers to the Resend account owner's address).
=======
"Controller fix request", sent from
`repairs@contact.vancouvercontrollerrepair.com`, and replies go straight back to
the customer. Both addresses live as `DEFAULT_RECIPIENT` and `DEFAULT_SENDER` at
the top of `app/api/repair-request/route.ts`; the sender domain has to stay
verified in Resend.

## Admin page

Open `/admin` directly. There is no link to it on the site. Sign-in checks
`ADMIN_PASSWORD` on the server and keeps you in with an HTTP-only cookie. The
password is not stored in the repository, and sign-in stays closed until that
variable is set.

Feedback is one form: a quote, a name, and photos. It is not tied to a joystick
type, and published entries replace the sample quotes in the feedback carousel.
Reviews added here are public immediately. Reviews that arrive through a
personal feedback link stay hidden until you approve them.

### Personal feedback links

The same admin page can create a private link for one customer:
`/feedback/` plus a random token. Enter their name, controller, repair, date,
and an optional note, then copy the link. The customer sees those details and
only adds a star rating, a review, and optional photos. Each link accepts one
submission, expires after 90 days if it is unused, and can be turned off or
replaced. Approve the review to publish it on the site, or delete it. These
invites are stored as Sanity drafts so the public dataset does not list the
links or the customer details. The customer can change the name shown on the
review. That does not change the name stored on the link.

Gallery photos have a date, and the home page shows the newest pictures first,
nine slots at a time. Written feedback has a display date. Screenshot reviews
are stored from the admin page and appear in the same feedback carousel.
`/shop` is a coming-soon page linked from the header.
Video links stay on Traditional, Hall Effect, and TMR, and show on the matching
card. A joystick with no video keeps its “Video coming soon” block. Photos added
under “Controllers we’ve brought back” replace the gallery placeholders.

### Connecting Sanity

1. Create a project at [sanity.io/manage](https://www.sanity.io/manage) and copy
   its project ID into `NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_PROJECT_ID`.
2. Create an API token with Editor permissions and put it in `SANITY_API_TOKEN`.
   This token is only read on the server.
3. In the Sanity project, add the document types from `sanity/schemaTypes`
   (`testimonial`, `joystickVideo`, `galleryImage`, and `feedbackRequest`) so
   the studio shows the same fields the site writes. The site can save content
   through the API either way. New fields are `takenOn` on bench photos,
   `shownOn`, `format`, and `screenshot` on feedback, and `displayName` plus
   `shownOn` on feedback links.
4. Redeploy after setting the variables. `NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_PROJECT_ID` is
   baked in at build time.

## Adding your own photos

Drop images in `public/` and reference them from the code:

- Gallery of finished repairs: the `gallery` array in
  `components/landing-page.tsx`
- Customer feedback photos: the `image` field in `lib/testimonials.ts`
- Repair option videos: the two placeholders in the "Choose your fix" section of
  `components/landing-page.tsx`

## Deployment

On Vercel, import the repository and add the environment variables in the
project settings.

On Netlify, `netlify.toml` already sets the build command to `npm run build` and
the publish directory to `.next`; add the environment variables under Site
configuration → Environment variables. Keep the server build — a static export
would break the `/api/repair-request` route the form posts to. Note that
`NEXT_PUBLIC_*` values are baked in at build time, so redeploy after changing
them.
